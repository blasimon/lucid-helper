# LUCID Assistant ‚Äî LLM-Powered Chatbot for lucidresearch.io

This is the front-end code powering the public-facing **LUCID Assistant**, which answers questions about the LUCID framework and related resources.

It uses:

- OpenAI Assistants API (I use 4.1 mini), not to be confused with the sentence completion API.
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Vercel serverless deployment
- Markdown rendering via `marked` and `sanitize-html`
- Fully self-contained ‚Äî no backend required beyond OpenAI

## üß™ Quick Demo

The assistant is live at:

**[https://helpwithlucid.vercel.app](https://lucid-helper.vercel.app)**

## üì¶ Deployment Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blasimon/lucid-helper.git
cd lucid-helper
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create `.env.local` file

Create a file named `.env.local` in your repo root with the following content:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=your-assistant-id-here
```

You can obtain these values from your OpenAI API account.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run locally for development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will run at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to Vercel

- Push your repository to GitHub.
- Connect your repo to Vercel.
- Add the same two environment variables inside Vercel's dashboard:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID`
- Deploy.

## üß† How It Works

- The frontend sends chat messages directly to the OpenAI Assistants API.
- Each conversation starts a new OpenAI thread.
- Responses are rendered with full Markdown support, including clickable links.
- Responses are sanitized safely using `sanitize-html` to prevent any XSS injection.

## üîß Technical Stack

- React (Next.js 14 App Router)
- OpenAI Node SDK 4.x (Beta API)
- `marked` for Markdown parsing
- `sanitize-html` for safe HTML output
- Deployed via Vercel Serverless Edge Runtime
